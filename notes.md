have some gui that interprets what the scorekeeper says 

special purpose with all the benefits

hybrid model where the speech part is informing an engine that captures the model of the game ,
including the history of the game 

amibiguities should be 

rule based systems -- 

if umpire review:
    need the following information
else:
    send to ai --> missing umpires, who are the umpires, 
general purpose models 


have a rule based engine that covers and understands the state of the game

and one that has the history of the game 

AI side process the speech --> Data is the rules of the Atlantic League --> state of the game -->   

archetecture is one of the big keys to this project

Have to fill in the blanks and make the problem as structured as possible

Sot eh reqs, architecture have to be structured 

show that this modality works, that someone can interact with this system and that it can store the state of the :game
