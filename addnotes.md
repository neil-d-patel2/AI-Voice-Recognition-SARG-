Data from broadcasters from past games 

Hit a line drive - “he hits a line drive, stops at first base”

X person Should reflect the database, store that in db 

“Hit a trick down the middle, he went to first, and is safe at first”

Y person Store this information in the second row - also equates to base one 

When pulling the rag lets say now youre in delaware, now this guy is talking from gibberish, and based on your currently embedded your model has to figure out what xyz people said. the rag "figures out what base the person is on based on what the announcer is saying, whether its first base, second base, third base  

Should be a label in the llm and the label equates to base. Based on what x and y person said, z probably means this. 


One stores truth of source , data in one vector db that shows the broadcasters text and the label , call target value base, which is one two three or home run (Which is test dataset) 


Now you have live data coming in and need to go against that, hit against that vector database, top k value (5) we can say with confidence that with this phrase we are confident that player is on base 2
